Welcome to my portfolio site! I look forward to working with you to provide high-quality web applications. Here are a few of my strengths:

* Working with Ruby on Rails or PHP to create functional user interfaces and data-driven web applications.

* Working with PosgreSQL and/or mySQL to create accurate, validated databases.

* Thinking ahead about database input, to minimize future maintenance and upkeep.

* Creating functional user interfaces that make sense to the user- features should be able to be found!

* Creating test suites for fully testable applications.


This project proved to be truly frustrating, and it is far from done or in 'portfolio quality' condition! However, I learned A LOT about 'polymorphic' relationships in ActiveRecord, and I'm grateful for having an understanding of it now.

Check out this great explanation of polymorphic (among other) relationships. Very thorough and understandable!
