# README

Welcome to my portfolio site! I look forward to working with you to provide high-quality web applications. Here are a few of my strengths:

* Working with Ruby on Rails or PHP to create functional user interfaces and data-driven web applications.

* Working with PosgreSQL and/or mySQL to create accurate, validated databases.

* Thinking ahead about database input, to minimize future maintenance and upkeep.

* Creating functional user interfaces that make sense to the user- features should be able to be found!
